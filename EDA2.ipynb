    "- **Imputation**: Replace missing values with calculated estimates (e.g., mean, median) based on non-missing data.\n",
    "- **Drop Missing Values**: If the number of missing values is small compared to the dataset, you might choose to drop rows with missing values.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Create a new feature that indicates whether a value is missing or not, which can provide valuable information to the analysis.\n",
    "- **Advanced Imputation Techniques**: Use more sophisticated methods, such as regression imputation or k-nearest neighbors imputation, to fill in missing values based on relationships with other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of how to handle missing values depends on the nature of the data, the analysis goals, and the potential impact on the results. It's important to document your approach and its potential implications in your analysis report."
